# Martian Time API 

After the Earth, Mars is the most habitable planet in our solar system due to several reasons:

- Its soil contains water to extract
- It is neither too cold nor too hot
- There is enough sunlight to use solar panels
- Gravity on Mars is 38% that of our Earth's, which is believed by many to be sufficient for the human body to adapt to
- It has an atmosphere (albeit a thin one) that offers protection from cosmic and the Sun's radiation
- The day/night rhythm is very similar to ours here on Earth: a Mars day is 24 hours, 39 minutes and 35 seconds

In any case, humans cannot live on Mars without the help of technology.

So what are the risks and challenges?

- Home sickness
- No social media
- No cable TV
- A contemplative life and the confinement of a monastic closure, which leaves the caruna lockdown as if it was living la vida loca 

##Endpoint
Well, anyway, this API allows to get the Mars Sol Date (MSD) and the Martian Coordinated Time (MTC) based on the time on Earth in UTC.
The **endpoint** is *time/convert/{UTC_time}*.
